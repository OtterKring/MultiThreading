# MultiThreading
Demo Code to show an alternative approach to foreach-object -parallel

## Files
* `FUNCTION___ThreadedProcessing.ps1`: the proof of concept demo code I wrote while developing this approach. The function needs the FakeNameGenerate...csv file as a data source.
* `FakeNameGenerator.com_71e0a582.csv`: a collection of randomly generated names and addresses. The .csv is the data source for the ThreadedProcessing function.
* `getOverLicensedDisabledMailboxesMT_DEMO.ps1`: a script I wrote to find oversized disabled users in our environment. Stripped from company data, of course. :-)
